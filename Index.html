         Take a breath and push on<br>	
			Smile like nothing’s wrong<br>
				Keep your thoughts to yourself<br>
			Make it seem like nothing is going on<br>
				Just hold on tight and remain strong<br>
			But this internal battle has been going on 
				For way to long<br>
			Seems like yesterday everything was fine<br>
				Now today something has crossed the line<br>
			I never knew I would feel pain like this<br>
				I love you now I hate you type of thing<br>
			Now I gotta keep thinking about what we could’ve been<br>
				Cause you’re on my mind<br> 
					  24/7

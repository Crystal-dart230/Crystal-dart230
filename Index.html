     <em><h3>
         Seeing shadows from the corner of my eyes<br> 
         The memory of you grips me tight <br> Voices unknown trying to comfort me<br> While the darkness tries to consume me <br>The once bright light that envloped me<br> Diminished the day you were taken from me<br>
         Why should a little girl grow up without her brother? <br> 
         Maybe one day we can find each other.......
